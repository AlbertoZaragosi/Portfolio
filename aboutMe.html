            <p>Hello, I'm Alberto Zaragosi Tenorio, a passionate programming enthusiast based in Spain. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Software Development (DAM) in an online format. My dream is to become a Software Developer.</p>

            <p>In my free time, I love to code and explore the world of technology. I have advanced knowledge in Java, Oracle, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I also have some experience with Python, C++, and Kotlin.</p>

            <p>My educational background includes a Technical High School Diploma, and I'm currently completing my degree in Software Development (DAM), both in Spain.</p>

            <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I'm a dedicated gamer and have a strong interest in the world of video games. I believe that this passion for gaming has shaped my enthusiasm for software development.</p>

            <h3 id="Education">• Education</h3>
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Degree in Software Development (DAM) in Spain Online. This program covers a wide range of topics in software engineering and development.</p>

            <h3 id="WhyIreland">• Why Ireland</h3>
            <p>Ireland has always been a place I have wanted to go, after going I fell in love with this beautiful place, that is why after researching I saw that Ireland is a technological power, which made me take the definitive step to come. I currently reside in Ireland, Blackrock along with my fiancée and our beautiful cat.
